# Katagoshi
Katagoshi is a simple monitoring tool that makes screenshots of your screen from time to time and saves them in a specified folder.

## Installing Katagoshi
Run

	npm install

to update the dependencies, fill in your credentials in the source code and then run


	node index.js

to let katagoshi run once.

It doesn't yet run in the background and take regular screenshots, nor does it send them automatically.
We're working on that.
